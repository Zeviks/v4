A simple, video chat app i designed and built. Built with [Next.js](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [WebRTC](https://reactjs.org/), [Socket.io](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), and styled with [CSS-Modules](https://www.npmjs.com/).</br> Designed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

Due to how **Next.js** backend functions, it does not **natively** support **WebRTC**. I used a third party library as workaround, but its very unstable. The server goes offline after a few calls to it have been made. At the moment the site mainly works only on the client. Currently working on migrating this project to **react**.
